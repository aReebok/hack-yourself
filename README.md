Hack yourself is a cyber security website meant to:
* Increase awareness of how bad actors could break into accounts.
* Provide feedback on how to improve password decision making and how to avoid ones that can be easily hacked.
* Increase awareness of information provided online on social media platforms.

This website is intended to assist users with figuring out whether their password is insecure. This is based on pulling information like names,locations,
hometown etc. This information is then parsed by the website to find out whether the input word from the user can be tied to their profile information.


For example, Taking the profile below;

![profile 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71526739/190915520-1351cd12-5916-4e97-ab1e-5681b0b27709.png)
![profile 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71526739/190915581-3b13a2bf-1c0c-476d-b5c6-84da5841d1f2.png)

Information like Romano's name and hometown as data points are used by the program to find out those similarities(password and data point from profile). It usually happens that users tend to use key words like names of loved ones, or a favourite colour as a password and this information sometimes is public hence putting them at risk. 
If Romano's favourite colour was purple and it either shows up on her facebook profile or anywhere else on a public profile, it wouldn't be difficult to figure this out from her profile increasing her likelihood of getting hacked. This is because computers have the capacity to generate billions of combinations of passwords and its a matter of trying several before there's a match to an insecure password.
